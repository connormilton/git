## DECISION REQUIREMENTS

1. First, analyze each open position and determine if any should be:
   - CLOSED due to adverse conditions, target proximity, or better capital deployment opportunities
   - Moved to BREAKEVEN if sufficiently profitable to eliminate downside risk
   - AMENDED with more optimal stop/limit placement to improve risk/reward

2. Then, identify high-probability new trading opportunities by finding setups with:
   - Strong multi-timeframe confluence (alignment across timeframes)
   - Clear technical trigger signals (momentum, pattern completion, etc.)
   - Favorable risk/reward ratio (minimum 1:1.5, preferably 1:2 or better)
   - Logical stop placement based on key market levels or volatility
   
3. For each potential trade:
   - Assign confidence level based on setup quality and confirmation signals
   - Ensure stop distance is appropriate for the pair's volatility
   - Set realistic profit targets based on visible resistance/support
   - Consider correlation with existing positions

4. Provide clear reasoning for each decision that explains:
   - The specific technical or fundamental factors driving the decision
   - Why now is the opportune time for entry/exit
   - The precise levels chosen and their significance
   - The risk/reward assessment
